# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
🗂️ Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset

🔹 Week 1: Project Setup & Understanding

✅ Download & explore the dataset

✅ Read the data description (PCA-transformed features + Time, Amount, Class)

✅ Understand class imbalance (Only ~0.17% fraud cases)

✅ Setup GitHub repo and README

🛠️ Deliverable: Exploratory notes on data structure and project goals

🔹 Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Visualize class distribution

✅ Analyze “Time” and “Amount” feature distribution

✅ Correlation heatmap

✅ Boxplots or histograms for outlier detection

✅ Check for missing values (there are none, but confirm)

📊 Deliverable: Visual EDA notebook (with insights)

🔹 Week 3: Data Preprocessing

✅ StandardScaler/RobustScaler for “Amount” and “Time”

✅ Split data into Train/Test sets (stratified)

✅ Save preprocessing code as reusable functions

🔁 Deliverable: Cleaned and scaled dataset, preprocessing script

🔹 Week 4: Baseline Models

✅ Train Logistic Regression (baseline)

✅ Train Decision Tree & Random Forest

✅ Use ROC-AUC, F1, Precision, Recall for evaluation

✅ Build a classification report table

🧪 Deliverable: Baseline model notebook with metrics comparison

🔹 Week 5: Handle Class Imbalance

✅ Apply SMOTE / UnderSampling / SMOTE+ENN

✅ Retrain models and compare metrics

✅ Use confusion matrix and ROC-AUC to evaluate fraud capture

📉 Deliverable: Notebook with models trained on balanced data

🔹 Week 6: Advanced Models & Tuning

✅ Try XGBoost or LightGBM

✅ Use GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearch for hyperparameter tuning

✅ Compare results with baseline models

⚙️ Deliverable: Final tuned model with comparison charts

🔹 Week 7: Model Explainability

✅ SHAP values for feature importance

✅ Plot most influential features for fraud prediction

✅ Interpret model predictions for a few examples

📌 Deliverable: Model explainability notebook + Summary plot

🔹 Week 8: Presentation & Deployment

✅ Prepare a Streamlit dashboard (optional)

✅ Create a project report (Markdown or PDF)

✅ Add to GitHub with README, requirements.txt, and visuals

🎯 Deliverable: Complete portfolio project, GitHub link ready for resume
