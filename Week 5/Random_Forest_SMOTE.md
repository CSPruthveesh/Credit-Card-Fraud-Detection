# 🌲 Random Forest + SMOTE – Evaluation Summary

---

## ✅ Positive Points

- **Massively Improved Precision (0.8144)** ✅  
  Slightly lower than baseline RF (0.9610), but still very strong — 81% of predicted frauds are correct.

- **Strong Recall (0.8061)** ✅  
  Caught 80.6% of frauds, up from 75.5% in the baseline.  
  → Much better balance between catching frauds and minimizing false negatives.

- **Best F1-score (0.8103)** ✅  
  Highest F1-score across all models so far — excellent harmony between precision and recall.

- **Low False Positives (18)** ✅  
  Only 18 normal transactions flagged incorrectly — much lower than:
  - Decision Tree + SMOTE: 148  
  - Logistic Regression + SMOTE: 1458

- **Strong ROC-AUC Score (0.9688)** ✅  
  On par with baseline RF (0.9581) and Logistic Regression (0.9722), indicating excellent discrimination power.

- **Excellent Accuracy (99.94%)**  
  While not prioritized, still a solid indicator of model consistency.

## 🧮 Confusion Matrix

|                         | Predicted Non-Fraud (0) | Predicted Fraud (1) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Actual Non-Fraud (0)** | 56,846                   | 18                   |
| **Actual Fraud (1)**     | 19                       | 79                   |

---

## ❌ Minor Trade-offs

- **Slight Drop in Precision vs Baseline RF**  
  - From 0.9610 → 0.8144 🔻  
  - Acceptable tradeoff given better recall and stronger F1.

- **Slightly Higher False Negatives (19 vs 24 in baseline)**  
  Still catching ~81% of all frauds — a very good result.
